# Raritas

Script, along with [softwares](https://github.com/plannapus/Raritas/releases) (compiled for Mac OS X El Capitan, Windows 7 and 10, and Ubuntu Xenial) for Raritas software implementing stratified counting.

To run the script, you will need to have `wxPython` and `matplotlib` installed with your version of python 2.7.
If you are using miniconda/anaconda, you will need to use the binary `pythonw` instead of `python` (so that wxPython can work).
