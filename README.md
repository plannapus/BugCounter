# Raritas

Script, along with [Mac OSX app](https://github.com/plannapus/Raritas/raw/master/Raritas_mac.zip) (compiled on Mac OS X El Capitan) and [Windows software](https://github.com/plannapus/Raritas/blob/master/Raritas/Raritas_PC.rar) (compiled for Windows 10 but tested in Windows 7 with success) for Raritas software implementing stratified counting.

To run the script, you will need to have `wxPython` and `matplotlib` installed with your version of python 2.7.
If you are using miniconda/anaconda, you will need to use the binary `pythonw` instead of `python` (so that wxPython can work).

RaritasVox is the original Java software, that includes a voice recognition mode. It has been written by Dorina Lenz and Jens Klump.

The 'Experimental' folder contains a beta-version with additional features.
