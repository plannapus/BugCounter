        <span class="PanelHeader">How to format the Taxa Name File</span><br/><br/>
        The File containing the informations on the taxa needs to be a tab-separated file.<br/>
        The file should contain at least 10 columns named <b>exactly</b> as follows:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Genus</b></li>
            <li><b>GQ</b> i. e. Genus Qualifier: usually a question mark, if needed. Can be empty field.</li>
            <li><b>Species</b></li>
            <li><b>SQ</b> i. e. Species Qualifier: can be a question mark, if needed, or a 'group', 'cf' or 'aff' statement. Can be empty field.</li>
            <li><b>Subspecies</b></li>
            <li><b>Author</b>: this column should be present but the field itself can be empty.</li>
            <li><b>Comment</b>: this column should be present but the field itself can be empty.</li>
            <li><b>HigherTaxon</b>: Field used for the grouping of species. Can be a number or a name. Try to avoid really long names (i. e. over 50 characters). Species with an empty field for that category won't be present in the lists!</li>
            <li><b>onButton</b>: 'y' if you want this species to be present as a button, 'n' otherwise. Try to limit the number of such species to less than 200.</li>
            <li><b>abbreviation</b>: for the species that are to be displayed as buttons, this field gives the desired label on the button. Optimally it should be a string of less than 12 characters.</li>
        </ul>
        The file can contain additional columns (for compatibility with RaritasVox) but the 10 columns mentioned here need to be present.

        <div>
        <span class="PanelHeader">Rare Count mode</span><br/><br/>
        The 'Rare Count' mode allows you, after a few tracks have already been counted, to discard the most abundant species from the count.<br/>
        These species will then be estimated based on the number of specimens per track that were counted during the 'Normal Count' mode phase.<br/>
        Warning: Those specimens will be added at the end of each new track. As a consequence the Collector's curve will have artificial large steps when this occurs.
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div>
        <span class="PanelHeader">Adding a new species during the count</span><br/><br/>
        There is the possibility to add a new species during the count by clicking on 'Add a new species'. <br/> Keep in mind that this species will only be added to this count and not to the original Taxa Name File. <br/> The species can be added to the scrollers but not to the buttons.
        </div>
        <br/>
<!--        <div>
        <span class="PanelHeader">Single Specimen mode <i>(not implemented yet)</i></span><br/>
        When this mode is triggered, counting one specimen of one species disable that species for further counting.<br/>
        Useful if 'occurrence' data instead of 'abundance' data are needed.
