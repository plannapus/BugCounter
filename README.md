# Raritas

Script, along with Mac OSX app (compiled on Mac OS X El Capitan) for Raritas software implementing stratified counting.

To run the script, you will need to have `wxPython` and `matplotlib` installed with your version of python 2.7.
If you are using miniconda/anaconda, you will need to use the binary `pythonw` instead of `python` (so that wxPython can work).

A version of Raritas compiled for Windows 10 is available [at this dropbox address](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51394019/Raritas_PC.rar).
