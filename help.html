        <span class="PanelHeader"><font size="20">How to format the Taxa Name File</font></span><br/><br/>
        The File containing the informations on the taxa needs to be a tab-separated file.<br/>
        The file should contain at least 10 columns named <b>exactly</b> as follows:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Genus</b></li>
            <li><b>GQ</b> i. e. Genus Qualifier: usually a question mark, if needed. Can be empty field.</li>
            <li><b>Species</b></li>
            <li><b>SQ</b> i. e. Species Qualifier: can be a question mark, if needed, or a 'group', 'cf' or 'aff' statement. Can be empty field.</li>
            <li><b>Subspecies</b></li>
            <li><b>Author</b>: this column should be present but the field itself can be empty.</li>
            <li><b>Comment</b>: this column should be present but the field itself can be empty.</li>
            <li><b>HigherTaxon</b>: Field used for the grouping of species. Can be a number or a name. Try to avoid really long names (i. e. over 50 characters). Species with an empty field for that category won't be present in the lists!</li>
            <li><b>onButton</b>: 'y' if you want this species to be present as a button, 'n' otherwise. Try to limit the number of such species to less than 200.</li>
            <li><b>abbreviation</b>: for the species that are to be displayed as buttons, this field gives the desired label on the button. Optimally it should be a string of less than 12 characters.</li>
        </ul><br/>
        Each <b>Genus+GQ+Species+SQ+Subspecies</b> combination needs to be unique!

        <div>
        <span class="PanelHeader"><font size="20">Rare Count mode</font></span><br/><br/>
        The 'Rare Count' mode allows you, after a few tracks have already been counted, to discard the most abundant species from the count.<br/>
        These species will then be estimated based on the number of specimens per track that were counted during the 'Normal Count' mode phase.<br/>
        Warning: Those specimens will be added at the end of each new track. As a consequence the Collector's curve will have artificial large steps when this occurs.
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div>
        <span class="PanelHeader"><font size="20">Adding a new species during the count</font></span><br/><br/>
        There is the possibility to add a new species during the count by clicking on 'Add a new species'. Keep in mind that this species will only be added to this count and not to the original Taxa Name File. The species can be added to the scrollers but not to the buttons.
        </div>

<!--        <div>
        <span class="PanelHeader">Single Specimen mode <i>(not implemented yet)</i></span><br/>
        When this mode is triggered, counting one specimen of one species disable that species for further counting.<br/>
        Useful if 'occurrence' data instead of 'abundance' data are needed.
