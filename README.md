# Raritas

Script, along with Mac OSX app (compiled on Mac OS X El Capitan) for Raritas software implementing stratified counting.

To run the script, you will need to have `wxPython` and `matplotlib` installed with your version of python 2.7. 
If you are using miniconda/anaconda, you will need to use the binary `pythonw` instead of `python` (so that wxPython can work).

`Raritas_experimental.py` is a version of the script in which additional, experimental features are tested.
